  FP II Service Learning
</h1>
<p><strong>2021-08-05</strong></p>
<div class="article">
  <p>Through this service learning, I learned that I should remind myself to be more grateful for what I have. I learned this when I was reminded of how my secondary school emphasized gratitude when doing the reflection. This learning matters because feeling grateful makes us happier people, according to this article by Psychology Today. In light of this learning, in the future I will try my best to be grateful in all circumstances, even when I am feeling down, I should look for something to be grateful for. Overall, this experience and reflection has made me think more about being a grateful person and how I can give back to the community through what I learn in school.</p>
