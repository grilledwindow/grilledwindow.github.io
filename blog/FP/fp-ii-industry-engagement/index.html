<h1>
  FP II Industry Engagement
</h1>
<p><strong>2021-08-05</strong></p>
<div class="article">
  <p>I attended two webinars, Nurturing Next Generation for STEM by the Singapore Computer Society (SCS), and Google I/O by Google. The talk by SCS helped me learn what it takes to be in the tech industry, and the conference by Google showed me that the tech industry just keeps growing.</p>
<p>These two talks have shown me what it means to be in the tech industry, where technological advancements are frequent, and that tech evolves quickly. I have learned what it means to keep up with such an industry by having a clear goal and a plan to reach that goal, connecting with individuals to stay rooted in my passion, and to sharpen my skills non-stop.</p>
