  Ecoplus IV: Final Words
</h1>
<p><strong>2022-02-13</strong></p>
<div class="article">
  <p>In the last two sprints, our entire team was busy with other assignments as well, so we had to help each other out and manage our time properly.
On some days, I would stay back in school with Wai Keat or Aung to work on the project together.
It made us more productive as we had to be accountable to one another for doing work, and we were able to help each other with any problems we had more easily through face-to-face communication.</p>
<p>All of us managed to contribute to the project amidst other assignments and we're all glad that we have improved our website to provide more functionality and a better user experience.
The website we created looks more complete now, and I'm grateful we were able to complete it.</p>
<p>As we come to a close, our team is happy that we can finally take a well-deserved break, but at the same time, I'm sad that we're going to disband.
Through this project, I have definitely improved on my coding and dabbled in new technologies, and at the same time, our team has fostered better friendships through this shared experience.
As such, PFD is one of the modules I enjoyed more as I got to exercise my coding skills and bond with my team, which I will definitely miss.</p>
<p>Bye :))</p>
