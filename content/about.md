# About me

## Personality

I am a reserved person and I think a lot.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy coding, exercising and photography. Coding interests me because I like solving problems and creating things with freedom. Exercising is good for relieving stress and staying healthy. Photography allows me to go down memory lane, to remember events I would have otherwise forgotten.

## Education

### Marsiling Primary School
2010 - 2015
I joined Tchoukball in 2013, but the CCA closed down in 2014 so I joined Taekwondo.
I was also a prefect
