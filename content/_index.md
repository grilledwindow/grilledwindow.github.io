## About me
I am a nice and chill guy. I enjoy coding for brain exercise, and working out for actual exercise.
In my free time, I watch shows and do fun projects. I'm currently learning to write with my non-domninant hand.
I also serve in the Boys' Brigade as a Primer, teaching the skills I learnt as a Boy to my juniors.
